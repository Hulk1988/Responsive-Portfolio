            <p> I'm newly a web developer taking this course to advance my career and fine-tune my skills.
                I have an associate's degree in math and science from Mira Costa College. I enjoy math and
                working with
                numbers. I was born in Ann Arbor Michigan in 1988. Shortly after I moved to Seattle,
                Washington. I spent a majority of my childhood in Washington until 1998, when I moved to
                Del Mar, California.
                For roughly over 20 years my current residence has been California. I enjoy eating and
                living healthy and decidied to start my own business doing so. For the past seven years i
                have ran my own
                mobile personal training company. During the process of building my business I was
                introduced to web design. While designing my company's needed up and coming website, I was
                inspired to learn more indepth
                the back functioning of coding.
